        <p id="bio" class="text">Now presenting Isaiah Anyimi. I was born in Sacramento on September 27th of the year 1999. I am 19 years old and in my first year of college at Loyola Marymount University. Born and raised in Sacramento, California, I live in a family of five. I have my mom and dad, along with my younger brother Jordan and even younger sister Madisyn. For high school I attended Rio Americano. </p>

        <p id="hobbies" class="text">One of my biggest hobbies is soccer. In high school, I played for both my high school team and a competetive club team. I started playing in my freshman year for Rio Americano. Then, as a sophmore, I continued to play to Rio but also joined a soccer club called Union FC. I played for both Rio and Union for the rest of high school. I stopped playing competetive soccer after high school, though I could have chose to play with the LMU club soccer team. However, I really enjoyed intramural soccer because it was a small commitment for fun. I also enjoy watching soccer and playing FIFA mobile on my phone.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">My Audio Addiction</h2>
    <hr>
      <p id="wildCard" class="text">My favorite activity to do, far ahead of all the others, is to listen to music. I'm obsessed with finding the ultimate listening experience. I listen to tons of hip-hop/rap/trap music with lots of low end frequencies. I'm always on the hunt for the next best speaker/pair of headphones to allow me to experience my music to the fullest. For example, if I could, I would by the Gold Phantom, a $3000 speaker made by a french company called <a href="https://www.devialet.com/en-us/phantom-premier-speaker/" target="_blank">Devialet<a>. The Gold Phantom is capable of procuing low end frequencies all the way down to 14Hz. At that point, the bass is felt rather than heard. I once had some red Sony headphones I was very satisfied with because they could produce all the low end I ever wanted, however, unfortunately they broke about a month ago. The headphones I am looking to replace them are the <a href="https://uk.jvc.com/microsite/uk/szfxz/sz/index.html#intro" target="_blank">JVC Kenwood HA-SZ1000's<a> made by a company called JVC. The HA-SZ1000's are professional studio headphones capable of porducing low end sounds down to 4Hz. They are so powerful that I would also need to by a portable amplifier and Digital Audio Converter (DAC) to support them.</p>
